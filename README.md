R// Ready

2.
R// The Java language is both compiled and interpreted. The compiler converts the source code that resides in files whose extension is .java, to a set of instructions called bytecodes that are saved in a file whose extension is .class. These instructions are independent of the type of computer. The interpreter executes each of these instructions on a specific computer (Windows, Macintosh, etc). Therefore, it is only necessary to compile the program once, but it is interpreted each time it is run on a computer.

R// 
```
INICIO
   VARIABLE Quetzales
   LEER <- Quetzales
   IMPRIMIR -> "Quetzales equivalentes en Dolares" Quetzales / 7.70

R// Ready

5.
R// When you're writing code in a programming language, you’ll have to battle with strict syntax and rigid coding patterns. But you write pseudocode in a language or form with which you're very familiar.

6.
R//
```
INICIO
Funcion calculateAge(birthDate):
    today = 2022
    age = today - birthDate.year
     
   Imprimir(calculateAge(birthDate), "Years")
FIN
```
7.
R// Ready

R//A software programmer can use flowcharts sketched on a whiteboard as part of efforts to explain his or her vision to a team of code developers.

Most programming languages that you will have heard of are high-level languages. Python and C# are examples of high-level languages that are widely used in education and in the workplace. A high-level language is one that is user-oriented in that it has been designed to make it straightforward for a programmer to convert an algorithm into program code.

A low-level language is machine-oriented. Low-level programs are expressed in terms of the machine operations that must be performed to carry out a task. This makes writing programs more difficult, as the algorithm must be specified in terms of the capabilities and specifications of the processor. Low-level languages are named for the processor (or processor family) that they are designed for, and are often referred to as assembly language or machine code.

BINARY, DECIMAL, HEXADECIMAL NUMBERS

Decimals
To understand binary and hexadecimal numbers, it is best to have a good understanding of how decimal numbers work.
Each digit of a decimal number goes in one "place", and the decimal point tells us what position each one is.
The position just to the left of the point is the "units". Every time we move to the left it is worth 10 times more, and to the right it is worth 10 times less:

```
17.591

1           7             .          5            9              1
Decenas - Unidades- Decimal point - Decimos - Centésimos - milésimos
```

But this is only a way of writing numbers. There are other ways like Roman numerals, binary, hexadecimal, and more. You could even mark dots on a piece of paper!
