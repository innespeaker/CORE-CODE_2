R// The Java language is both compiled and interpreted. The compiler converts the source code that resides in files whose extension is .java, to a set of instructions called bytecodes that are saved in a file whose extension is .class. These instructions are independent of the type of computer. The interpreter executes each of these instructions on a specific computer (Windows, Macintosh, etc). Therefore, it is only necessary to compile the program once, but it is interpreted each time it is run on a computer.

R// When you're writing code in a programming language, youâ€™ll have to battle with strict syntax and rigid coding patterns. But you write pseudocode in a language or form with which you're very familiar.

Most programming languages that you will have heard of are high-level languages. Python and C# are examples of high-level languages that are widely used in education and in the workplace. A high-level language is one that is user-oriented in that it has been designed to make it straightforward for a programmer to convert an algorithm into program code.

A low-level language is machine-oriented. Low-level programs are expressed in terms of the machine operations that must be performed to carry out a task. This makes writing programs more difficult, as the algorithm must be specified in terms of the capabilities and specifications of the processor. Low-level languages are named for the processor (or processor family) that they are designed for, and are often referred to as assembly language or machine code.
